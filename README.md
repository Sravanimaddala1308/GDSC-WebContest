Problem Statement:
create a dynamic and eye-catching online resume that will make a lasting impression on any potential employer.

To begin, use the "h1" tag to create a heading for your name, and include your personal details, such as your address, phone number, and email address, using "p" tags.

Next, create a section for your education, using the "h2" tag to create a heading. Use "p" tags to list your degrees, majors, and any relevant coursework.

In the achievements section, use "h2" and "ul" tags to create a bullet point list of your accomplishments. This is a great place to highlight any awards, publications, or other relevant achievements.

For the work experience section, use "h2" tags to create a heading for each position, and include the company name, your job title, and the dates you worked there using "p" tags. Use "ul" tags to create a bullet point list of your responsibilities and accomplishments for each job.

Finally, use the "h2" tag to create a skills section. Use "ul" tags to create a list of your skills, and include any relevant certifications or licenses using "p" tags.

By developing your resume as a webpage using just HTML, you'll demonstrate your technical skills while creating a visually appealing and professional-looking online resume that will help you stand out in a competitive job market
